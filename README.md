# Faithy's Calculator

## Overview
This project is a simple, functional calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division..

## Features
- Basic math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)
- Responsive design
- Input validation to ensure users provide valid numbers in the input box.
- Switch-case

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling
- JavaScript for functionality

## Project Structure
```bash
Calculator Project/
├── index.html   # Main HTML file containing the calculator structure.
├── index.css   # CSS file containing the style elements of thr calculator.
├── script.js     # JavaScript file containing the logic for calculations.
└── README.md    # This file, describing the project.
```

## How to Use the Calculator
1. Ensure number(s) are entered in the input fields labeled "Enter number.."
2. Choose an arithmetic operation from the dropdown menu
3. Click the "Submit" button to see the result.
4. The result of the operation will be displayed below the form.

### Input Validation
-  Number(s) must be entered in the input.

## To run locally:
1. Clone this repository or download all the files in this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your  browser.After which you should see the calculator interface and be able to perform operations.


## Future Enhancements
 In the nearest future, I’ll modify this calculator to look like a basic phone calculator with fixed clickable numbers and a “clear button” to reset inputs/results. Farther in the future, I’ll modify it to include advanced math operations and a history feature.
